    "A company is considering whether to invest into a high-risk external project or a virtually risk-free internal project. The profit from the external project depends on whether a remote economic market experiences an upturn or a downturn. If there is an upturn, the external project will yield a profit of 6.3 thousand euros but if there is a downturn, the external project will cause a loss of 4.9 thousand euros. The internal project will yield one thousand euros regardless of the market developments. The company has estimated the probability of there being an upturn in the remote market to be 0.5. The company is risk-neutral in its investment decision making.\n",
