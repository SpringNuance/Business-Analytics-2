    "(a) Consider first a retailer that is not using blockchain. Their consumer demand is stochastic and freshness-dependent: $D = \\lambda + \\beta X+ \\epsilon$, where $\\lambda$ is a baseline level of demand, $\\beta$ is sensitivity of demand to freshness, and $X$ and $\\epsilon$ are independent normally distributed random variables, such that $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_X^2)$ and $\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$. The variable $\\epsilon$ describes an idiosyncratic demand shock and the variable $X$ describes uncertain freshness of supply. For simplicity the variable X is mean-centred at zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the baseline level of demand is $\\lambda = 357.46$ kg, sensitivity is $\\beta = 82.38$ kg/day, and $\\sigma=44.72$ and $\\sigma_X=0.6509$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assume also that the retailer buys its stock with wholesale price 1 eur/kg and sells it with retail price 3 eur/kg. There is no salvage value with the stock that is unsold. The retailer is risk-neutral and maximises profit. Use the model to answer the following questions: what is the optimal level of fresh food to stock, and what is the associated expected profit with that level?\n"
